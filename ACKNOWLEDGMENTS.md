## A Huge Thank You to the Original Author

This project is a fork of the incredible [Muli Physics Engine](https://github.com/Sopiro/Muli) created by **[Sopiro](https://github.com/Sopiro)**.

We want to express our deepest gratitude and appreciation for the amazing work that went into creating Muli. The original codebase provided an exceptional foundation with:

- **Clean, well-architected code** that demonstrates best practices in physics engine design
- **Comprehensive feature set** including continuous collision detection, various joint types, and efficient constraint solving
- **Excellent documentation** and intuitive API design that makes the engine accessible and easy to understand
- **Educational value** through clear code structure and thoughtful implementation

The quality and thoughtfulness of the original Muli engine has been instrumental in making this fork possible. While this project will evolve and diverge over time, it stands on the shoulders of the excellent work done by Sopiro.
